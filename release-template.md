### Pacific Drive UEVR profile

Import this profile to UEVR using dedicated function

**You need UEVR nightly from this link**: https://github.com/praydog/UEVR-nightly/releases/tag/nightly-796-c25695a8c0ec35b556229046cc7011e27f4d42ee
More recent versions **might** work. I don't accept bug reports unless they are reproducible on recommended version.

Uses **right motion controller** for camera and held items
* If you want to play with gamepad or mouse, open UEVR menu, go to 'Input' and set 'Aim Method' box to 'Game'.
	In car camera fix and hand bound items are not active in this mode
* If you want to use left controller, open UEVR menu, go to 'Input' and set 'Aim Method' box to 'Left Controller'

In case your new aim method does not stick close the game and inject again.

New **inventory access** method:
* to access inventory short press system menu button (i.e. left oculus button on quest)
* to access save/load/quit menu long press system menu button
