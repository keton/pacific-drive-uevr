## Mod Features

### Fixed in-car camera and held items

* Default: uses **right motion controller** for camera and held items
* If you want to **play with gamepad or mouse**, open UEVR menu, go to 'Input' and set 'Aim Method' box to 'Game'.
	In car camera fix and hand bound items are not active in this mode
* If you want to **use left controller**, open UEVR menu, go to 'Input' and set 'Aim Method' box to 'Left Controller'

In case your new aim method does not stick close the game and inject again.

### Easy access to both inventory and system menu on VR motion controller

New **inventory access** method:
* to access inventory **short press** (<200ms) system menu button (i.e. left oculus button on quest)
* to access save/load/quit menu **long press** system menu button (200-1200ms)
* to access long press of 'select' (radio transmissions, journal links, quest list collapse) **keep holding** system menu button longer than 1200ms. The in game marker will start to fill and once it's full menu will trigger.

## Backup install instructions

__Do yourself a favor and use discord guides at the top if you can.__

Import `PenDriverPro-Win64-Shipping.zip` to UEVR using dedicated function in UEVR Injector. 

Alternatively unpack it to `%APPDATA%\UnrealVRMod\PenDriverPro-Win64-Shipping` (you may need to create `UnrealVRMod` and `PenDriverPro-Win64-Shipping`)

**You need UEVR nightly from this link**: https://github.com/praydog/UEVR-nightly/releases/tag/nightly-796-c25695a8c0ec35b556229046cc7011e27f4d42ee
More recent versions **might** work. I don't accept bug reports unless they are reproducible on recommended version.
